# What is iShell?
**iShell** contains a set of extensions for windows explorer.

Contains a set of extensions for windows explorer, the first extension provides the ability to display 
thumbnails for ***svg*** files as well as the ability to display a preview in the preview pane of file explorer.

I hope it helps someone. :smirk:

# Usage

## Thumbnails

Below in the image we can see how the explorer shows us the contents of a folder that contains a series of svg files without using the extension and how it would be displayed when using the extension.

![svg_thumbnails][svg_thumbnails] 

## Preview

Below in the image we can see how the explorer shows us the contents of a folder that contains a series of svg files without using the extension and how it would be displayed when using the extension.
